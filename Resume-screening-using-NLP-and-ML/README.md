Resume-screening-using-NLP-and-ML
This project automates the process of shortlisting resumes by analyzing and ranking candidates based on job requirements using Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It extracts key information like skills, experience, and education from resumes and compares them with job descriptions to
